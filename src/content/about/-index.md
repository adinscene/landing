## Transforming Video Content into Smart Ad Inventory

Adinscene is an intelligent video advertising platform that revolutionizes how media companies monetize their content. By leveraging advanced AI technology, we transform every second of video content into valuable, contextually relevant advertising opportunities.

### Our Mission

We believe that advertising should enhance, not interrupt, the viewing experience. Our mission is to create a seamless integration between content and advertising by ensuring ads are contextually relevant and perfectly timed within video content.

### How It Works

Our platform uses a sophisticated multi-step process to analyze and monetize your video content:

1. **Content Ingestion**: Clients send us their video content through API, FTP, or their preferred method
2. **AI Analysis**: We process videos using advanced machine learning models to:
   - Generate subtitles using AWS Transcribe or other Speech-to-Text models
   - Analyze visual content to identify scenes, objects, and contexts
   - Tag content with relevant metadata (e.g., "beach scene" from 05:30 to 05:55)
3. **Ad Placement**: Enable precise targeting based on keywords, scenes, or contexts
4. **Campaign Management**: Advertisers can create campaigns, set limits, and monitor performance
5. **Real-time Delivery**: Serve contextually relevant ads through integration with any ad platform
