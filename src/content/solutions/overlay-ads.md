## Overlay Ads: The Future of Non-Intrusive Monetization

Traditional video advertising forces viewers to stop watching. Overlay ads change that paradigm by monetizing content while it plays, creating a win-win for publishers and viewers.

### Why Overlay Ads Are Essential

**Changing Viewer Behavior**: Audiences expect uninterrupted experiences
**Ad Blocker Resistant**: Harder to block than traditional formats
**Mobile Optimization**: Perfect for small screens
**Incremental Revenue**: Add to, don't replace, existing ads

### Technology That Makes It Work

Our overlay system uses:

**Computer Vision**: Identifies safe placement zones
**OCR Technology**: Avoids covering text and graphics
**Motion Tracking**: Adapts to camera movements
**Scene Context**: Triggers relevant overlays

### Integration Options

**Client-Side**: JavaScript SDK for web players
**Server-Side**: SSAI integration for broadcast
**Mobile SDK**: iOS and Android native support
**OTT Platforms**: Smart TV and streaming device compatible

### Revenue Optimization Strategies

**Frequency Optimization**: Find the sweet spot for overlay frequency
**Format Testing**: Test different overlay types and sizes
**Contextual Targeting**: Match overlays to content themes
**Dayparting**: Adjust strategy by time of day

Transform your video monetization with non-intrusive overlay advertising that respects your content and your audience.
